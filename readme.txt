Everybody know the value of a fast loading blog,but we found many blogs is very very slowly.
Many webmaster wonder Why are their web site is so slowly?OK, the answer is advertising code.

It is very simple to let it working,what you need to do is:

1:named  id of div in the textarea of plugin.  //for example:"myad1"

2:copy your advertising code  in the textarea of plugin.// for example:<script>xxxxxxx¡­¡­</script>

Then Just use these div  id in your widget,sidebar,index.php¡­¡­
